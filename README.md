## Professional Experience
**Research Assistant @ Arizona State University (_October 2022_ - _Present_)**
- Working on offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm using decision transformer in non-markovian setting.
- Devised a novel multi-agent RL algorithm that converges 10 times faster than state of art methods in Stochastic game setting.
- Designed a novel RL algorithm that utilize causal information and outperforms traditional approaches by 5 fold.
- Created 3 OpenAI GYM compatible simulation environments.

**Machine Learning Intern @ Simhatel Technologies (_October 2021_ - _March 2022_)**
- Developed a Mask RCNN-based semantic segmentation model for detection of flat and slanted regions of the berm and achieved 91% accuracy with an inference speed of 1.28 seconds.
- Generated depth maps of input monocular images using the MiDaS CNN model with an accuracy of 83%.

## Academic Projects
#### TennisBot [GitHub Link](https://github.com/YashPaliwal19/TennisBot)
Prototyped an autonomous robot for tennis ball collection. Trained an YOLOv8 nano model on custom dataset of 600 images, to detect tennis balls location with an accuracy of 98% and operating at a speed of 1 FPS.

#### Object 6D Pose Estimation [GitHub Link](https://github.com/YashPaliwal19/TennisBot)
Implemented PVN3D algorithm in docker to detect 6D pose of an object using a RGBD image. Improve the accuracy of the algorithm by 2% by modifying the loss function and using the ResNet-101 network.


#### Reinforcement learning PACMAN agent [GitHub Link](https://github.com/hssahdev/AI_Team_Project)
Implemented and analyzed the performance of the Q-learning and True Online SARSA algorithm in PACMAN game over 100 iterations on randomly generated maps.

#### AI Virtual Mouse [GitHub Link](https://github.com/YashPaliwal19/AI-Virtual_mouse)
Built a computer vision module for mouse and keyboard control via hand gestures with an operating speed of 33 FPS. Utilized the MediaPipe framework to track hand joint positions in real-time and assigned 8 mouse and keyboard functions to different gestures.

#### Six-Axis Robot Arm [GitHub Link](https://github.com/YashPaliwal19/TennisBot)
Designed a 6 D.O.F. serial mainpulator in SolidWorks and simulated it in Gazebo using R.O.S..
