## Professional Experience
**Research Assistant @ Arizona State University (_October 2022 - _Present)**
- Working on offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm using decision transformer in non-markovian setting.
- Devised a novel multi-agent RL algorithm that converges 10 times faster than state of art methods in Stochastic game setting.
- Designed a novel RL algorithm that utilize causal information and outperforms traditional approaches by 5 fold.
- Created 3 OpenAI GYM compatible simulation environments.

**Machine Learning Intern @ Simhatel Technologies (_October 2021 - _March 2022)**
- Developed a Mask RCNN-based semantic segmentation model for detection of flat and slanted regions of the berm and achieved 91% accuracy with an inference speed of 1.28 seconds.
- Generated depth maps of input monocular images using the MiDaS CNN model with an accuracy of 83%.
